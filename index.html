	        <h3>Hello World!</h3>
	    	<p>This is a simple HTML5 webpage built from scratch. No CSS has been added yet</p>
	    	<p>HTML is the building block of every webpage.</p> 
	    	<p>Web pages are similar to the pages of books we read. We hold our books in our palm of our hand while reading them, and often store them away in the shelve after use.</p>
	    	<p>Web pages reside on the internet.</p>
	    	<p>They are kept at location on the internet known as websitesalways available use.</p>
	    	<p>HTML pages are just texts with special features. to add flavor to them, we require another language known as CSS</p>

	    </div>
	    <div class='col-3'>
	        <h3>CSS? Yay!!!</h3>
	            <p>CSS adds style and color to our web page</p>
	        	<p>CSS also helps us layout our we pages properly</p>
	        	<p>We shall be using CSS to style this web page soonest. Meanwhile, I recommend you take a look at the whole page again, get used to all the elements, and so we are back to continue the real deal</p>
	        	<p>You may right-click on your browser wider, click on viw-page source to review the build for this page</p>
	        	<p>Thank you!</p>
